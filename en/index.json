	"content": " Bitcoin and Blockchain Bitcoin was born with revolution, and it opened a new world that currency issuance becomes open and fair by a cryptography-based decentralized payment network. With the arrival of 10-years birth of bitcoin, the blockchain infrastructure is facing various challenges from technical aspects. The underlying mechanism of Bitcoin, the blockchain, was found capable of playing a significant role in the financial field.\na blockchain is an immutable transaction database, which maintained by peer nodes which communicated with each other within a Peer-to-Peer distributed network. For each peer, which validate and apply transactions according to a consensus protocol. The transcations grouped into blocks that linked by a hash from one block to the preceding block, aka the chain of block which is the name of blockchain is comming from.\nQitmeer BlockDAG Qitmeer regards openness,fairness, fault tolerance, scalability as the core metrics to assess a promising blockchain paradigm, and a blockchain system achieved a desirable balance among these metrics is regarded as Classical Blockchain Setting.\nQitmeer use SPECTRE as its fundamental Consensus protocol. SPECTRE is a fast-confirmation and high-throughput BlockDAG protocol(Directed Acyclic Graph of blocks, a blockDAG), which guarantees high performance in a payment network. Additionally, Qitmeer introduces another high-throughput BlockDAG protocol GhostDAG, which is highlighted on unprecedentedly supporting transactions linearly ordering, to circumvent SPECTRE\u0026rsquo;s weak liveness and provide ordering service for the fair scheme of the reward system.\nQitmeer POW Qitmeer Consensus is compliant with Classical Blockchain Setting - it could enter and leave network freely by Proof-of-Work, and the collaboration model of DAG ledger guarantees that miners gain rewards consistent with their devotion, 50\\% faulty tolerance as secure as bitcoin, robust scalability that is only subject to physical network limit. The mining algorithm is also a vital source of fairness other than consensus algorithm per se. Cuckoo Ring is a graph theory based proof-of-work mining algorithm and is practically ASIC resistant due to memory-hard calculation.\nQitmeer token \u0026amp; Isamlic financial ecosystem Qitmeer originates a UTXO-based unique token insurance scheme, which has effectively answered two main concerns: Intrinsic Value and Assets Authentication. Issuing a certain amount of assets must consume a certain amount of the native currency; moreover, entities must be warranted a license to issue assets.\nQitmeer devises a family of specifications and protocols to embrace the whole Isamlic financial ecosystem, such as wallet and miners. As for interoperability, Qitmeer calls for utilizing cross-chain protocols to integrate various cryptocurrencies and offer reliable off-chain smart contract services.\nQitmeer mining difficulty adjustment "

	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "Q: relationship between blockchain and blockDAG.\nA: Through the evolving history from BlockChain to BlockDAG, it may indicate that BlockChain is a particular case of BlockDAG in the event of low throughput, which means both are the same in essence. As a result, it is the scaling approach whose paradigm is the closest to the bitcoin network. BlockDAG is robust since it inherits all the long-time-proved stable features of bitcoin. Furthermore, it could scale infinitely in terms of protocol, unless it is limited physically, such as network bandwidth and propagation delay. A robust public chain is an optimal basis for incorporating further scaling solutions, such as sharding and state-channels; thus, BlockDAG is the preferred scaling solution of Qitmeer.\nQ: how does SPECTRE work with GHOSTDAG.\nA: SPECTRE works perfectly for the payment network. Its stateless voting consensus algorithms brings extreme fast confirmation time; in other words, users wait merely a few seconds to accept a transaction. However, the trade-off is that it does not support the total ordering of transactions that GhostDAG could offer, which will bring two problems.\nFirstly, it would make double-spending transactions delayed indefinitely. This weakness will merely affect malicious users since only they have the capability. Nevertheless, Qitmeer hopes that the protocol is robust enough to make sure every case behaving consistently. Therefore, once such incident happens, GhostDAG will solve the conflict by their global order.\nSecondly, the rewards mechanism requires an ordered block list to prioritize mining rewards. Although GhostDAG rewarding confirmation is not as fast as SPECTRE, the mining rewards demands a long time maturity to spend, which is quite enough for GhostDAG to reach confirmation.\nQ: Qitmeer innovation on BlockDAG.\nA: Qitmeer consensus protocol mainly originates from 3 BlockDAG papers published by DAGlabs - SPECTRE, GHOSTDAG and Inclusive.\nSPECTRE\u0026rsquo;s matches the high liquidity demands of Qitmeer due to its fast confirmation, high throughput and bitcoin equivalent security. GHOSTDAG solves SPECTRE\u0026rsquo;s weak liveness and provides total ordering service for rewards mechanism.\nQitmeer utilizes Inclusive to design its rewards mechanism, which has provided a weighted algorithm to balance the priority service in terms of transaction fee and transaction collision.\nQitmeer is grateful for DAGlabs work and has contributed power to DAGlabs community as a return. However, as we all believe, there is a long distance from research to implementation.\nFirst, integration has excellent value. Bitcoin\u0026rsquo;s most significant innovation is that it has integrated various existing technologies rather than invented them. As far as we know by now, there are some proof-of-concept projects, even complete projects, implemented an individual protocol, but none of them has integrated all. As I just analyzed, the three papers are solving different problems and should work with each other as a whole system.\nSecond, optimization is critical to practice. The paper provides theory support for core problems but inevitably skips details. For instance, the reference algorithms for SPECTRE and GHOSTDAG are intensive in computation, whereas Qitmeer has optimized both consensus algorithms by totally independent work. Moreover, the high throughput will bring high pressure on ledger storage, Qitmeer has proposed a compact storage solution to alleviate this problem. Also, Qitmeer will give a proposal on how to improve the bandwidth efficiency to increase scalability.\nQ: why choose SPECTRE as core consensus protocol\nA: SPECTRE is a secure BlockDAG protocol with fast confirmation and high throughput. GHOSTDAG supports total ordering of transactions, which is the foundation of on-chain smart contract but sacrifices fast confirmation. So there is a trade-off between fast confirmation and on-chain smart contract.\nQitmeer is dedicated to serving Islamic finance, which requires massive liquidity support, so high throughput and fast confirmation are the most top priority. Qitmeer never planned to implement on-chain smart contract because it is still too intensive in computation even though BlockDAG is scalable. We believe you still have an impression on the CryptoCat incident, which caused ethereum denial of service. Another consideration is that SPECTRE has a more straightforward design and two years maturity. We don\u0026rsquo;t find any security risks feedback so far, so Qitmeer tends to trust it is desirably robust.\n"

	"content": "Q: Why choose Cuckoo Cycle POW?\nA: Proof-of-Work(PoW) is used to confirm transactions and produces new blocks, therefore it is a very important engine in PoW cryptocurrencies. PoW must not enable a participant to have a significant advantage over another participant. That is why Satoshi said: \u0026ldquo;Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote.\u0026rdquo; However, most widely used proof-of-work algorithms, such as SHA-256, Blake2b, Scrypt, are more efficient on ASIC devices when compared to CPUs and GPUs. This can lead to ASIC owners posses a much larger voting power than CPU and GPU owners. It violates the “one-CPU-one-vote” principle.\nCuckoo-Cycle-PoW ,a graph-theoretic proof-of-work algorithm. It is ASIC resistant. This algorithm focuses more on memory use, meaning the solution time is bound to memory bandwidth rather than the raw processor or GPU speed.\nThe Cuckoo-Cycle algorithm is designed to find certain subgraphs in large pseudo-random graphs. In particular, Search for cycles of specified length L in a bipartite graph with M edges of N nodes. If a cycle is found and the hash difficulty is less than the target difficulty, the cuckoo cycle PoW is completed.\n"
