#### Bitcoin and Blockchain

Bitcoin was born with revolution, and it opened a new world that currency issuance becomes open and fair by a cryptography-based decentralized payment network. With the arrival of 10-years birth of bitcoin, the blockchain infrastructure is facing various challenges from technical aspects. The underlying mechanism of Bitcoin, the blockchain, was found capable of playing a significant role in the financial field.

a blockchain is an immutable transaction database, which maintained by peer nodes which communicated with each other within a Peer-to-Peer distributed network. For each peer, which validate and apply transactions according to a consensus protocol.
The transcations grouped into blocks that linked by a hash from one block to the preceding block, aka *the chain of block* which is the name of blockchain is comming from.

#### Qitmeer BlockDAG

Qitmeer regards openness,fairness, fault tolerance, scalability as the core metrics to assess a promising blockchain paradigm, and a blockchain system achieved a desirable balance among these metrics is regarded as Classical Blockchain Setting.

Qitmeer use SPECTRE as its fundamental Consensus protocol. SPECTRE is a fast\-confirmation and high\-throughput BlockDAG protocol(Directed Acyclic Graph of blocks, a blockDAG), which guarantees high performance in a payment network. Additionally, Qitmeer introduces another high\-throughput BlockDAG protocol GhostDAG, which is highlighted on unprecedentedly supporting transactions linearly ordering, to circumvent SPECTRE's weak liveness and provide ordering service for the fair scheme of the reward system. 

#### Qitmeer POW

Qitmeer Consensus is compliant with Classical Blockchain Setting - it could enter and leave network freely by Proof-of-Work, and the collaboration model of DAG ledger guarantees that miners gain rewards consistent with their devotion, 50\% faulty tolerance as secure as bitcoin, robust scalability that is only subject to physical network limit. The mining algorithm is also a vital source of fairness other than consensus algorithm per se. Cuckoo Ring is a graph theory based proof-of-work mining algorithm and is practically ASIC resistant due to memory-hard calculation.

#### Qitmeer token & Isamlic financial ecosystem

Qitmeer originates a UTXO-based unique token insurance scheme, which has effectively answered two main concerns: Intrinsic Value and Assets Authentication. Issuing a certain amount of assets must consume a certain amount of the native currency; moreover, entities must be warranted a license to issue assets.

Qitmeer devises a family of specifications and protocols to embrace the whole Isamlic financial ecosystem, such as wallet and miners. As for interoperability, Qitmeer calls for utilizing cross-chain protocols to integrate various cryptocurrencies and offer reliable off-chain smart contract services.
